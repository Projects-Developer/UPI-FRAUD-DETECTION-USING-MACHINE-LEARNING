### Abstract :

The increasing adoption of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has led to a rise in fraudulent transactions. To combat this, we propose a real-time UPI fraud detection system using machine learning and data analytics. Our system collects transaction data from various sources, including banks and payment gateways. We then apply machine learning algorithms, such as random forest and support vector machine, to identify patterns and anomalies in the data. The system also uses data analytics techniques, including statistical analysis and data visualization, to provide insights into fraudulent transactions. Our system is designed to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, allowing for prompt action to be taken to prevent financial losses. We evaluated our system using a dataset of real-world UPI transactions and achieved an accuracy of 95% in detecting fraudulent transactions.
